## Welcome to my Art Shop!! ü©∑ [Under Construction... üõ†Ô∏è]

This is a cozy, gamefied website created to market my art to customers. This will (hopefully) be an interactive web app, that makes the user feel like they are stepping into a physical shop. They can interact with items around them, discover secret surprises, pet cute animals, and (of course) view and purchase my artwork. I'm creating this website with Next.js, Tailwindcss, and Stripe!

Here is a quick sketch of the layout, something that will continue to be refined and rendered:
<img width="3072" height="1920" alt="shop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f5a690-5908-40ae-b4f2-882df07cd33b" />



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
