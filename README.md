## Welcome to my Art Shop!! 🩷 [Under Construction... 🛠️]

This is a cozy, gamefied website created to market my art to customers. This will (hopefully) be an interactive web app, that makes the user feel like they are stepping into a physical shop. They can interact with items around them, discover secret surprises, pet cute animals, and (of course) view and purchase my artwork. I'm creating this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), Tailwindcss, and Stripe!

Here is a quick sketch of the layout, something that is still to be refined:

Here is the current layout:

## Key Features ⭐
1. Commissioning
    - Customers can message me (the frog!) to request a commission.
    - I will see the commission on my end (you can also send me a nice message if you'd like!), and reply to the customer. This also enables a chat feature where we can talk back and forth about details for the commission.
    - Once the commission is in progress or completed, I can adjust the status for the customer to view.

3. Shop + Products
    - All my products are displayed on a little shelf for you to see!
    - Each product has a small description, price tag, and quantity button, and you can add any to your cart.
    - There is a feature for people to leave reviews for future customers to see.

4. Capsule Gacha Machine
    - This is a little reward system (and incentives for people who like gambling!)
    - Through purchases, you can earn more coins and use it to get a little capsule toy.
    - Prizes include discounts, free gifts, and (most commonly) cat gifs!

5. Community Garden
    - This is a little area where users can add their own special touch to the website
    - Customers draw a flower, and it grows in the community garden for everyone to see, along with everyone else's flowers.

6. Art Gallery

7. Account Profile
    - In order to place an order or commission, people must first make an account. Through your account profile, you can view the orders + commissions you have placed, and keep track of them!

## Currently Working On...
I hope to improve the UI of the landing page so that the images scale the same and stay in the same positions no matter the dimension of the screen/device it is displayed on. This is especially crucial for mobile!! I also want to improve the aesthetics of some items and elements (e.g. replace the capsule machine with a hand-drawn version) to maintain cohesiveness and the home-y vibe.
I also want to get started on pushing out real products (right now they are just placeholders), so I will start creating them and taking pictures to upload.

## Tools
I'm developing this web app using Next.js, React, Supabase, and Stripe!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
