## Welcome to my Art Shop!! ü©∑ [Under Construction... üõ†Ô∏è]

This is a cozy, gamefied website created to market my art to customers. This will (hopefully) be an interactive web app, that makes the user feel like they are stepping into a physical shop. They can interact with items around them, discover secret surprises, pet cute animals, and (of course) view and purchase my artwork. I'm creating this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), Tailwindcss, and Stripe!

Here is a quick sketch of the layout, something that is still to be refined:

<img width="3072" height="1920" alt="Untitled_Artwork 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9e4ed2f-e5b3-4699-9d29-45d36025b632" />

Here is the current layout:
<img width="1470" height="826" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace74d97-f2d7-406e-b47b-8243eb68e64a" />


## Currently Working On...
My next steps will be to actually implement the functionality of the web app. I want customers to be able to create an account/profile and keep track of items in their cart/what they have already purchased. I also want to create a chat feature so customers can directly communicate with me. 

As for design, I hope to improve the UI so that the images scale the same and stay in the same positions no matter the dimension of the screen/device it is displayed on. I will add a parallax effect, so when the user moves their cursor, the items move in a way that looks like the user is turning. I will also add more items, ways to explore/interact, and hidden surprises!!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
